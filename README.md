# 📝 AI Text Summarizer (Offline + Fast)

An offline, AI-powered text summarizer web app built with **Streamlit** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
This app takes any large chunk of text and summarizes it into a concise, easy-to-read format.  
Designed with **fast loading**, **clean UI**, and the ability to run entirely **offline** after setup.

## 🛡️ Notes
- The first time you run the app, it will download the summarization model from Hugging Face.  
- After that, the model will be **cached locally** for offline use.  
- For faster performance, consider using a **GPU** with PyTorch installed.
